%% This function performs bipolar referencing for data recorded from SEEG channels, based on input channel names.
%
%   Bipolar signals are calculated as the signal difference between two adjacent electrode contacts on the same SEEG lead.
%   To determine which channels should be subtracted from each other, this function requires the channel names to be in
%   the format 'XXXnn', where 'XXX' = chars of any length that represent the unique name of an SEEG lead, and 'nn' is
%   the electrode position on that lead, starting from 1. E.g. 'LA12' is the 12th electrode along the 'LA' lead.
%
%   The bipolar signals are then calculated starting from the 1st electrode in a lead upward, in the order of
%   subtracting the smaller odd number lead from the larger even number lead. E.g. LA1 - LA2, LA3 - LA4 ...
%   There is no shared component between any pair of returned bipolar signals. Any remaining singular (odd) electrode at
%   the end of a lead (e.g. LA15) is not included in the bipolar derivations. Similarly, the user can specify a
%   numerical list of bad channels, and any pairs containing a bad channel will not be included in the bipolar
%   derivations. "Good" channels that aren't included in the bipolar derivation (i.e. those at the end of leads, those 
%   paired to bad channels) will have their indices returned in <excludedChans>.
%
%   Usage:
%   [dataOut, bipolarChans] = ieeg_bipolarSEEG(dataIn, channelNames, []);
%   [dataOut, bipolarChans, excludedChans] = ieeg_bipolarSEEG(dataIn, channelNames, badChans);
%       dataIn =            txn double. Signal data: rows are samples, columns are channels. Signal should be already
%                               highpassed so that the amplitude of adjacent channels are comparable.
%       channelNames =      nx1 cell{char array}. Channel names must be in the same order as columns of <dataIn>. See
%                               the first paragraph of the documentation for how channel names should be formatted.
%       badChans =          mx1 num, m <= n. Indices of bad channels to not use in bipolar derivation. Channels paired
%                               to bad channels will be listed in <excludedChans> if they are themselves not bad.
%
%   Returns:
%       dataOut =           txb double. Bipolar-referenced signal data. Rows are samples, columns are re-referenced
%                               channels. b will be <= n/2, because original channels have been paired up to form the
%                               rereferenced data.
%       bipolarChans =      bx2 cell. 1st column contains channel pair names corresponding to columns in <dataOut>.
%                               The names take the form 'ch1-ch2', e.g. 'LA1-LA2' to represent which pair of channels
%                               are used for the derivation. 2nd column contains 1x2 array of input channel indices
%                               matching the channel pair names.
%       excludedChans =     px1 num. Indices of good channels in the original <dataIn> that were excluded during bipolar
%                               derivation. See second paragraph of docstring. [badChans; excludedChans] will give
%                               the complete list of all indices to SEEG channels not used in bipolar derivation. Note,
%                               this list will not include channels corresponding to incorrectly-formatted names, such
%                               as 'ECG' or '12'.
